## Fluffio

Meet Fluffio: a lightweight tooltip/popover library that utilizes the brand-new Popover API.

> fluffio is currently under development. Please be aware that it has limited number of features and doesn't (yet) work in browsers that don't support Popover API

Fluffio requires two things: an anchor (reference) node, and a popover (tooltip) node


## How To Install?

```shell
npm i @fluffio/core
```
