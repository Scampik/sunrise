## Fluffio

Fluffio is a small library that helps you create floating elements like tooltips based on the Popover API.

## How To Install?

```shell
npm i @fluffio/core
```

## How Its Work?:

Anchor Positioning: Snap a floating element (such as a tooltip) to another element (such as a button), while keeping it as visible as possible and avoiding collisions.
